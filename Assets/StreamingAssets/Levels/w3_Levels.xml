    <!--
    ======== Interesting moments ========
    * Use Crate to rotate BeamSource to pull it out of a cove
     
    ======== Combinations to explore ========
    * Side-Pull Rotatable BeamSource, BeamGoal, Mirror
    * Side-Pull Crates with regular Crates (x3)
     
    ======== Rejected/Implemented Interesting moments ========
    * We can only rotate a Rotatable, Movable BeamSource either clockwise or counter-clockwise. :) (No one level can just do this, but it does come up on its own.)
    * Exit blocked by Side-Pull  (can't easily make a level based around this small moment)
    * Walls + Beams (not inherently interesting)
